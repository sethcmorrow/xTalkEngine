Name: draggable

Type: property

Syntax: set the draggable of <stack> to {true | false}

Summary:
Shows a <stack|stack's> <title bar>.

Associations: stack

Introduced: 1.0

OS: mac, windows, linux

Platforms: desktop, server

Description:
The <draggable> <property> is included in <OpenXTalk> for compatibility
with imported <SuperCard> projects.

In SuperCard, the <draggable> <property> determines whether a window can
be dragged by its <title bar>.

In OpenXTalk, setting this property sets the stack's <decorations>
<property> to "title". Setting the <stack|stack's> <draggable> back to
false does not change the <stack|stack's> decorations.

Setting the <draggable> <property> causes the <stack window> to flash
briefly.
