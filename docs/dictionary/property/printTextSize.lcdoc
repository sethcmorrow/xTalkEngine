Description:
In HyperCard, the <printTextSize> <property> specifies the font size of
printed text. In OpenXTalk, only <card(object)|cards> can be printed, and
the size of text on the <card(keyword)> is determined by the <textSize>
<property> of the <object|objects> that display text.

By default, the value of <printTextSize> is 14. A <handler> can set the
<property>, but the new setting has no effect.
