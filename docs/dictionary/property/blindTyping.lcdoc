Name: blindTyping

Type: property

Syntax: set the blindTyping to {true | false}

Summary:
Has no effect and is included in <OpenXTalk> for compatibility with
imported <HyperCard> <stacks>.

Introduced: 1.0

Platforms: desktop, server

Description:
In HyperCard, the <blindTyping> <property> determines whether the user
can type into the <message box> when the <message box> is not visible.

In OpenXTalk, the message box always acts as though the <blindTyping> is
set to false: it must be visible for the user to type into it.
